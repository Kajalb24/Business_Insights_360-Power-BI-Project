Welcome to my Power BI Data Analytics project repository! Here, I am excited to share the insights and interactive dashboard I created during my Power BI course. I had the privilege of working on a practical project during the course, where I used real-like data to build a comprehensive dashboard. This hands-on experience allowed me to understand the true potential of Power BI and how it can empower businesses to make data-driven decisions. This project showcases various analyses, including net sales, gross margin, net profit by market (country), region, and customer level, along with top/bottom performers and key performance indicators (KPIs).

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the hardware company's performance, allowing users to:

ðŸ”¹ Analyze Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Net Profit figures across different markets (countries), regions, and customer segments.

ðŸ”¹ Identify Top and Bottom performing customers, markets (countries), and products based on market share, profit, and other essential KPIs.

ðŸ”¹ Track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and measure business success against set targets and goals.

The interactive and user-friendly design empowers end-users to explore the data and extract meaningful insights effortlessly.
